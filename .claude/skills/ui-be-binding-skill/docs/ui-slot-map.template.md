# UI Slot Map

This file defines exactly where backend data may appear in the approved UI.

If a backend field is not mapped here, it must not be rendered.

This file defines approved slots. It does not prove the current code is already wired correctly. Use the active plan's `YYYY-MM-DD-actual-wiring-status.md` to record current code reality before implementation.
