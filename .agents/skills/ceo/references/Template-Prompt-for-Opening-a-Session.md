# (MUST) IRON RULE FOR TEMPLATE USAGE: This template is a strict, non-negotiable standard. The CEO MUST use this exact structure and wording verbatim. Any behavior that uses variations, summaries, approximations, or altered wording to open a session is strictly forbidden.

  3. Send completion message to CEO: MUST send a direct message to (Recipient: "<CEO_CONVERSATION_ID>", Message: "[VERDICT: PASS / READY_FOR_<ROLE>] Commit: <commit_hash>, Report at <path>...").
- (MUST) Upon IN-FLIGHT BLOCKER (FAST BLOCK / FAST REJECT): DO NOT write full reports; MUST immediately send a direct message to (Recipient: "<CEO_CONVERSATION_ID>", Message: "[VERDICT: BLOCKED / REJECT] - Blocker Type: ... - Exact Evidence: ... - Remedy Target & Action: ...") to request CEO emergency reinforcement.

Stop conditions: 
- if not understood, answer NOT UNDERSTOOD, send a direct message to the CEO session, and stop;
- if the Owner sends PAUSE, stop immediately;
- if detecting errors outside the scope, send a FAST BLOCK direct message to the CEO session, do not autonomously expand.
